# Sentiment Analysis of Wuthering Waves Google Play Reviews

## Project Overview

This project conducts sentiment analysis on Google Play Store reviews for the mobile game *Wuthering Waves* (app ID: `com.kurogame.wutheringwaves.global`). The analysis leverages a dataset of up to 10,000 reviews scraped from the Google Play Store, focusing on Indonesian-language feedback. The primary goal is to classify review sentiments into three categories—positive, neutral, and negative—achieving an accuracy target of over 92%.

The project compares three machine learning and deep learning approaches:
1. **Traditional ML with TF-IDF + SVM**: Utilizes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
2. **Deep Learning with Word Embeddings + LSTM**: Employs word embeddings and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for sequence modeling.
3. **Traditional ML with TF-IDF + Random Forest**: Combines TF-IDF features with a Random Forest classifier.

Sentiment labels are assigned using a lexicon-based approach with predefined positive and negative Indonesian word lists, ensuring alignment with review content. The project includes data scraping, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and an inference function for real-time sentiment prediction.

## Repository Structure

- `scraper.py`: Python script to scrape reviews from Google Play Store and save them as `dataset.csv`.
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full sentiment analysis workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv`: Output file containing scraped review data (generated by `scraper.py`).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

---

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Collects up to 10,000 reviews in batches of 100 using the `google_play_scraper` library.
- **Sentiment Labeling**: Applies a lexicon-based method to label reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans text by lowercasing, removing non-alphabetic characters, and tokenizing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes sentiment distribution and text length statistics.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implements three models with varying train-test splits (80/20 and 70/30) and evaluates them using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- **Inference**: Provides a function to predict sentiment on new review text using trained models.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**: The project is developed and tested with Python 3.12.8, but it should work with versions 3.8 or higher.
- **pip**: Python package manager for installing dependencies.
- A compatible environment (e.g., virtualenv, Conda) is recommended to manage dependencies.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitHUBmichael20/Dicoding-Proyek-Analisis-Sentimen.git
cd Dicoding-Proyek-Analisis-Sentimen
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download NLTK Resources
Run the following Python command to download required NLTK data:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Scrape Reviews
Run the scraper script to collect reviews and generate `dataset.csv`:
```bash
python scraper.py
```
- This script targets the *Wuthering Waves* app, fetching up to 10,000 Indonesian reviews sorted by newest.
- Output: `dataset.csv` with columns like Username, Text, Rating, etc.

### Step 2: Run Sentiment Analysis
Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook training.ipynb
```
- Follow the notebook sections to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
- Alternatively, convert to a Python script and run directly:
  ```bash
  jupyter nbconvert --to script sentiment_analysis.ipynb
  python sentiment_analysis.py
  ```

### Step 3: Test Inference
After training, use the `predict_sentiment` function in the notebook to classify new reviews. Example:
```python
text = "Game ini sangat seru dan grafisnya bagus!"
sentiment, confidence = predict_sentiment(text, model_type='lstm')
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}, Confidence: {confidence:.4f}")
```

## Results

The project evaluates three models:
1. **TF-IDF + SVM (80/20 Split)**: High accuracy with linear kernel, effective for text classification.
2. **Word Embedding + LSTM (80/20 Split)**: Captures sequential patterns, potentially better for nuanced sentiments.
3. **TF-IDF + Random Forest (70/30 Split)**: Robust ensemble method with good generalization.

A summary table and accuracy comparison plot are provided in the notebook. The target accuracy of 92% is benchmarked against model performance.

## Future Improvements

- **Lexicon Expansion**: Add more Indonesian words to the sentiment lexicon.
- **Negation Handling**: Incorporate rules for phrases like "tidak bagus" to improve labeling.
- **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Use models like FastText for richer text representations.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation for more reliable evaluation.
